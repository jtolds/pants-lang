i'm trying to develop a programming language

THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT ANYWHERE NEAR READY FOR PRIME TIME.
at this stage this is at very best a toy. BE WARNED

cirth is a simple, stackless, dynamically typed, compiled, multiparadigm,
statically but optionally dynamically scoped, garbage-collected,
continuation-based language

sample:

    func := { |x|
     k := return
     if (< x 10) {
       print(x)
       func (+ x 1)
     } {
       f := { |x|
         print (1000 +. x)
       }
       print 70
       f 70
       f = k
       f 100
       print 80
     }
    }
    { print func(1) } @if true
    { print func(5) } @if false

this generates a c program that outputs

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9
    70
    1070
    100

for more samples, check out the standard prelude in src/assets

still to come: a bunch of stuff.
