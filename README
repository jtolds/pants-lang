i'm trying to develop a programming language

THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT ANYWHERE NEAR READY FOR PRIME TIME.
at this stage this is at very best a toy. BE WARNED

cirth is a simple, stackless, dynamically typed, compiled, multiparadigm,
statically but optionally dynamically scoped, garbage-collected,
continuation-based language

for code samples, check out tests/ or the standard prelude in src/assets/

still to come: a bunch of stuff.
