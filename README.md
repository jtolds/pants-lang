# ![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jtolds/pants-lang/master/art/logo.png) Pants programming language

*Warning:* Pants is currently in a very early *alpha* stage.

## About Pants

Pants is a simple, stackless, dynamically typed, compiled, multiparadigm,
statically but optionally hygienically dynamically scoped (holy adverbs),
garbage-collected, continuation-based language. MLIA.

Please see http://www.pants-lang.org/ for more info.

Pants is designed to have the powerful DSL-creation flexibility of Ruby,
combined with the scope hygienics and philosophy of Python, in a language
with a semantics as simple as R5RS Scheme (hopefully).

The language is intentionally designed with static analysis in mind for
future optimization and speed. Further, care has been given to keep the
core language both small and powerful, such that as many language features
as possible can be implemented within the language.

For code samples, check out
[samples/](https://github.com/jtolds/pants-lang/tree/master/samples),
[tests/](https://github.com/jtolds/pants-lang/tree/master/tests), or the
[standard prelude](https://github.com/jtolds/pants-lang/blob/master/first-c%2B%2B-impl/src/assets/prelude.p).

The beginnings of a language tutorial are on the wiki at LanguageIntroduction.
