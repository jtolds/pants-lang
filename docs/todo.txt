todo
 * type method
 * arbitrary arg (any enumerable) sending
 * right keyword arg reception and sending
 * right optional args reception and sending
 * wiki pages and docs
 * malloc benchmarking
 * c primitives
 * pants primitives
 * all other primitives

language decisions
 * either reject parsing {|:(left), a1, a2;| null}, or handle
   {|a1, a2, ::(left);| null} and {|::(left), a1, a2;| null} differently
 * i guess right arguments need the same decision

parser
 * make in_arg and out_arg order more picky in the parser
 * strings
 * better comments
 * more unit tests

language problems
 * infix is gross
 * function calls with no arguments are gross

upcoming optimizations
 * globalization of as many vars as possible
 * env rewrite (minimize new environments)
 * elimination of useless assignments
