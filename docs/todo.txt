todo
 * wiki pages and docs
 * rewrite (python?)
   * fix parser to keep track of code position
   * fix parser to handle comments better
   * provide interpreter
   * sparse conditional constant propagation
   * live variable analysis
   * generate tail-recursive c code
   * write cheney gc (ditch boehm)

language decisions
 * either reject parsing {|:(left), a1, a2;| null}, or handle
   {|a1, a2, ::(left);| null} and {|::(left), a1, a2;| null} differently
 * i guess right arguments need the same decision

parser
 * make in_arg and out_arg order more picky in the parser
 * strings
 * better comments
 * more unit tests

language problems
 * infix is gross
 * function calls with no arguments are gross

upcoming optimizations
 * globalization of as many vars as possible
