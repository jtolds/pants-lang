todo
 * wiki pages and docs
 * c primitives
 * cirth primitives
 * arrays/dictionaries
 * all argument styles passing
 * exceptions using kappa environments
 * all other primitives

parser
 * make in_arg and out_arg order more picky in the parser
 * strings
 * better comments
 * more unit tests

language problems
 * infix is gross
 * function calls with no arguments are gross

possible super easy optimizations
 * runs of variable definitions should be compacted into a single continuation
   call
 * definitions should only end up being mutated nulls if the rhs has the
   definition's lhs as a free-var
